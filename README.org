Every programming language has a formally defined structure, but most text
editors are completely ignorant to it. As a result, editing can oftentimes
devolve into a tedious exercise in character manipulation.

*Tree-edit provides [[#supported-languages][language-agnostic]] editing operations that map directly to
the structure of the language*, abstracting away the process of manually
entering syntax. Leveraging the [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] parser, tree-edit always has access
to the precise state of the syntax tree -- and directly wields the grammars of
the languages under edit to power it's editing capabilities.

* Getting started
Tree-edit is consists of two packages: *tree-edit*, a library for providing
structural editing, and *evil-tree-edit*, a package which exposes this
functionality as evil state with preconfigured bindings and visualization (as
seen above). To get an overview of tree-edit's full capabilities, check out the
[[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/structural/][EmacsConf talk]]!

The following sections of the README describe usage with *evil-tree-edit*. See
[[file:doc/using-tree-edit.org][here]] for a short guide on using the library.

After installation, add hooks for any language you'd like tree-edit to
automatically enable in.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'java-mode-hook #'evil-tree-edit-mode)
#+end_src

It's also recommended to use tree-edit with an autoformatter in it's current
state, as tree-edit does not always produce text consistent in formatting with
the surrounding nodes. If your language provides a performant formatter, you can
even run it after every editing operation:
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'evil-tree-edit-after-change-hook #'my-format-buffer-command)
#+end_src
* Usage
The concept of the *cursor*, a position in the 2D plane of text, is replaced by
the *current node*, which is a position in the syntax tree in tree-edit. All
operations unless otherwise specified are performed on the current node. To help
visualize the syntax tree, tree-edit provides @@html:<kbd>@@M-x
tree-edit-view-mode@@html:</kbd>@@ as seen in the demo GIF.

Tree-edit adopts a vim-style approach to editing, where certain operators also
require a noun. In vim's case, the nouns are text objects; In tree-edit's case,
the nouns are node types. For example,
@@html:<kbd>@@i@@html:</kbd>@@@@html:<kbd>@@v@@html:</kbd>@@ would insert a
variable declaration. Due to the fact that most languages contain a large number
of node types, and vary across languages, *using [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] with tree-edit is
highly recommended.*

To activate tree-edit from normal state, press @@html:<kbd>@@Q@@html:</kbd>@@,
and to return to normal state press @@html:<kbd>@@ESC@@html:</kbd>@@.

** Navigation
The navigation primitives follow the tree structure of the language.

| Operation                   | Keybind                        | Description                                                                         |
|-----------------------------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Next                        | @@html:<kbd>@@j@@html:</kbd>@@ | Move cursor to the next sibling.                                                    |
| Previous                    | @@html:<kbd>@@k@@html:</kbd>@@ | Move cursor to the previous sibling.                                                |
| Inwards                     | @@html:<kbd>@@f@@html:</kbd>@@ | Move cursor to the first child.                                                     |
| Outwards                    | @@html:<kbd>@@h@@html:</kbd>@@ | Move cursor to the parent.                                                          |
| Jump to                     | @@html:<kbd>@@s@@html:</kbd>@@ | Avy jump to a node of /node-type/ for a node inside the current.                    |
| Outwards Significant        | @@html:<kbd>@@A@@html:</kbd>@@ | Move outwards until a significant node (e.g. function or class declaration) is hit. |
| Goto Placeholder            | @@html:<kbd>@@n@@html:</kbd>@@ | Jump to the first placeholder node within the current.                              |

The definition of a placeholder node is configurable, but generally it's the
=TREE= identifiers as seen in the GIF demo.

** Editing operations
The most important feature of tree-edit: editing the syntax tree.

For any editing operation, the syntax will be added or deleted based on the
needs of the operation. For example, when adding an additional argument to a
function, tree-edit can infer that a comma is needed based on the grammar of the
language.

=tree-edit-syntax-snippets= defines how node types will actually be represented
upon insertion: see example [[https://github.com/ethan-leba/tree-edit/blob/main/tree-edit-java.el#L29][here]].

Any transformations will be rejected if a syntactically valid result cannot be
generated.

** Pasting
Along with the standard node-types of the given language, tree-edit has a
special node-type @@html:<kbd>@@p@@html:</kbd>@@ that will attempt to parse the
type of the most recently copied text. If a type can be identified and the
operation is valid, the copied text will be used.

** A note on raise vs. delete, wrap vs. insert

Both of the following definition for argument list produce the same result on a
textual level:

#+begin_src
argument_list = expression | seq[expression "," argument_list]
argument_list = seq[expression, repeat["," expression]]
#+end_src

However, at the tree level, these two constructions result in different ways to
modify the node.

For the first construction, you'd need to use raise/wrap to add and remove expressions:
#+begin_src
(foo, [bar]) ==raise==> (foo)
([foo])      ===wrap==> (foo, bar)
#+end_src

While for the second, you can use insert/delete.
#+begin_src
(foo, [bar]) ==delete=> (foo)
([foo])      ==insert=> (foo, bar)
#+end_src
This is something you may need to be aware of if you're running trying to
perform an operation that you think should work, but doesn't! In doubt, check
the =grammar.js= of the language.

* Supported languages

| ðŸ”¨ | Under development       |

Tree-edit is designed to be as language-agnostic as possible. Currently the list
of supported languages is not very impressive, but /in theory/ it should be as
simple as running a script to preprocess a grammar and adding a configuration
file for the language.

See [[https://github.com/ethan-leba/tree-edit/blob/docs/doc/using-tree-edit.org#adding-new-languages-to-tree-edit][here]] to learn the process for adding a new language.

* Customization

Currently adding customization ontop of the preset language files requires a
fair bit of boilerplate, but here's some code to get started.

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'tree-edit-java
  (with-mode-local java-mode
    (setq-mode-local
     java-mode

     tree-edit-syntax-snippets
     (append
      ;; Put your snippets here
      '((identifier . ("FOOBAR")))
      tree-edit-syntax-snippets)

     tree-edit-nodes
     (append
      ;; Put your nodes here
      '((:type if_statement
         :key "z"
         :name "if-else statement"
         :node-override '((if_statement . ("if" parenthesized_expression block "else" block)))))
      tree-edit-nodes)))

  (evil-tree-edit-set-state-bindings 'java-mode))
  #+end_src

  See [[file:tree-edit-java.el]] and the docstrings of the accompanying variables
  for more information.

* Limitations

A non-comprehensive list of some of the larger limitations that tree-edit currently has:

- Impedance mismatch :: Most tree-sitter grammars were not designed with
  tree-edit's usecase in mind, so some grammars may be structured inconveniently
  for tree-edit's purposes.

- Tree-sitter-langs :: Tree-edit currently depends on [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs][tree-sitter-langs]] to power
  the tree-sitter parsers, however tree-sitter-langs does not always have the
  most up-to-date grammars and is missing some languages. If this continues to
  be an issue a fork may be needed.

* Implementation

To learn more about how tree-edit works under the hood, see [[file:doc/implementation.org][this high-level
overview]] or check out this [[file:doc/parser-examples.org][org doc with executable code examples]] demonstrating
how the syntax generation works.

* Contributing

Contributions are very much welcome! In particular, adding language files would
be a great place to help. Otherwise, the issues are a good place to propose
features or find ones to implement.

The project is fairly complex and the documentation is still in progress, so
feel free to open a discussion if you're interested in helping out but you're
not sure where to start!

Tests can be run using =./run-tests.sh= script.
